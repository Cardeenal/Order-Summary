            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny's worth.

            " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR Startup "

            " Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br> never written a line of code. I
            needed <br> some structure from proffessionals <br> who can help me learn
            programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former
            student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the
            program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They
            were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The
            agile team project, in <br> particular was outstanding. It took <br> my
            learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever
            have. In <br> fact, I've often refferred to it during <br> interviews as an
            example of my development experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a
            job as a fullstack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100%
            recommended! "
